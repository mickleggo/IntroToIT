<!-- Let me just prefess this with, it feels very wierd writing about yourself
in the third person, so please forgive any inconsistencies.
My whole thought of this page was since we were told to make a profile I would
try and make mine look like the old CIA Person Profiles.
Having that in mind I made an attempt, having no knowledge of how html works,
and finding as I went that I hate this way of coding. Just feels and looks messy.
But this is my final product, definitly wasted way too much time on this,
especially for such a stupid idea. Due to security concerns with the internet
as well, I editted the image to pixelled it, and removed any information that
could be used to identify a person, though some of the black boxes are also
just for a bit of a laugh. -->

      MICHAEL is in his thirties having grown up in eastern Australia before
      moving west for work.

    <p>
      For the past decade MICHAEL has worked as a Technician in industry, and
      as such holds a <b><i>Certificate V Diploma of of Electronics and Communication
      Engineering</b></i>. <br>It is an area that MICHAEL has shown much interest in and
      seeks to expand his field of knowledge about.
    </p>
    <p>
      MICHAEL has worked the past decade for <img src="blackbox.jpeg" width="250" height="17" />.
      With them he has travelled to a lot of countries including; New Zealand, USA,
      <img src="blackbox.jpeg" width="150" height="17" />, <img src="blackbox.jpeg" width="90" height="17" />,
      Sweden, <img src="blackbox.jpeg" width="110" height="17" />, as well as many others.
      <br> In total MICHAEL has visited 27 countries, including his home country of Australia.

    <h3>Potential Alias</h3>
    <p>
      MICHAEL has always shown a tendency to work in the engineering fields, generally
      with electronics though that has limitted him in the past. MICHAEL has even
      worked on large tasks such as <img src="blackbox.jpeg" width="450" height="17" />
      where he <img src="blackbox.jpeg" width="650" height="17" />. The nature of this
      task ment MICHAEL had to lead a small team to complete the task in a restricted
      amount of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this in mind, you can expect MICHAEL to be working in the field where
      he isn't just maintaining equipment but will also be fault finding as well as
      research and development.
    </p>
      <hr>
    <h3>Construct Scheme</h3>
    <p>
      The are three product that MICHAEL is trying to complete, wether it is as a team
      of by himself is yet to be seen. Though these are often being delayed or posponed
      due to his employers <img src="blackbox.jpeg" width="250" height="17" /> sending
      MICHAEL on jobs out of location. Often with little to no warning.
      <br><br>
      <dt><b>Concept One: Solar Tracker.</b></dt>
        <dd>
          <b>Goal:</b> Develop a stand for a solar panel that allows it move on two axis to allow
          the panel to track with the sun. Task also requires the development of the software
          required to control the motors to steer the unit.
          <br> Current progress on the project include <img src="blackbox.jpeg" width="700" height="17" />
          <img src="blackbox.jpeg" width="550" height="17" /> which cost a total of
          <img src="blackbox.jpeg" width="90" height="17" />.
          <br> It will require a CAD for the mechanical design.
          Software development would be done utilising an Arduino for controlling the motors.
          <br><br> This task has a good balance between mechanical design and software
          development.
        </dd>
      <dt><b>Concept Two: Power Supply Tester.</b></dt>
        <dd>
          <b>Goal:</b> Plan and develop a device that would allow a technician or entusiast to plug a
          PC power supply into the device utilising standard connectors and once powered. Give a
          go/no go signal to indicate the power supply is outputting the correct voltages.
          <br> Software such as those provided by <i>National Instraments</i> would be used to verify effectiveness
          of circuit design, and software like <i>Eagle</i> could be used for moving from prototype into production.
          <br> <img src="blackbox.jpeg" width="1120" height="17" />
          <br> <img src="blackbox.jpeg" width="1120" height="17" />
          <br> <img src="blackbox.jpeg" width="1120" height="17" />
          <br> <img src="blackbox.jpeg" width="420" height="17" />
          <br><br> This task is heavier on a mechanical construction though it will be for
          testing PC power supplies.
        </dd>
      <dt><b>Concept Three: Environment Noise Cancelling Microphone</b></dt>
        <dd>
          <b>Goal:</b><s>Taking the input from a second microphone placed away from the
          primary microphone that the customer users, to take a sample of external noise that would
          be picked up from the main. Invert this new signal and then add it to the primary
          microphone to reduce or cancel entirely the background noise that is often heard by
          others.</s>
          <br> This task has currently been cancelled due to MICHAEL finding the product already
          developed on the market.
          <br><br> This project is entirely based on software development.
